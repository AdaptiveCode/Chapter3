# AdaptiveCode
## Chapter 3

Code samples to accompany the book Adaptive Code Via C#.

This repository contains code samples for chapter 3

### Notes

- Cross Cutting Concerns sample requires a trial license for PostSharp. This solution is omitted from the AppVeyor CI build. I'm in the process of porting this sample to Fody, instead.
- Original code samples used ASP.NET MVC v4. I'm in the process of porting to ASP.NET MVC v5.
